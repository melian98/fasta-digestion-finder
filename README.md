# fasta-digestion-finder
This repository contains the the python code that can take in a list of restriction enzymes and their digestion sites as well as a single well-formatted fasta sequence and output the digested fasta sequence with each enzyme

testdna.fas:  An example of a well formatted fasta file that can be used in restriction_site.py

enzyme_list: an example of a well formatted text file containing examples of restriction enzyme names and their digestion sites.

restriction_site.py:  This python code will prompt the user for the name of a single well formatted fasta file containing a single fasta sequence alongside a well formatted file containing the restriction enzyme names and sites. It will then output a page showing how the nucleotide sequence would be digested by each of the restriction enzymes in an easy to read format
